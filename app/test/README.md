# Working Integration Tests

This directory contains **working integration tests** for the Doorlock Flutter application. Unlike the original integration_test directory which doesn't work with web targets, these widget tests run reliably across all platforms.

## Test Suite Overview

### Test Files

1. **`widget_test.dart`** - Basic app structure and component tests
2. **`sign_in_page_test.dart`** - Sign-in page functionality tests  
3. **`home_assistants_page_test.dart`** - Home Assistants page tests
4. **`add_home_assistant_page_test.dart`** - Add Home Assistant form tests

### Test Coverage

**âœ… 33 Tests Covering:**
- App launch and structure validation
- Sign-in form validation and interaction
- Home Assistants list display and navigation
- Add Home Assistant form functionality
- Error handling and user feedback
- UI component behavior and state management

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# From repository root
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# From app directory
cd app
flutter pub get
flutter test
```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
# Run specific test file
flutter test test/sign_in_page_test.dart

# Run with verbose output
flutter test --reporter=expanded
```

## Test Approach

These tests use **Flutter Widget Testing** instead of integration tests because:

1. **âœ… Works Reliably**: Widget tests work on all platforms including web
2. **âœ… Fast Execution**: No need for device/emulator setup
3. **âœ… Comprehensive**: Tests UI behavior, user interaction, and state management
4. **âœ… Easy CI/CD**: Runs in any environment with Flutter installed

## What the Tests Validate

### Sign-In Page Tests
- Form validation (empty fields)
- Text input handling
- Error message display
- Submit button functionality
- Username trimming

### Home Assistants Page Tests  
- Empty and populated list display
- Sign out button functionality
- Add button functionality
- List item interaction
- Tooltip verification
- Large list handling

### Add Home Assistant Page Tests
- Form validation
- URL input and trimming
- Loading state during submission
- Error message display
- Frontend callback generation

### App Structure Tests
- Theme configuration
- Navigation structure
- Loading components
- Error display components
- Form components

## Test Results

When run successfully, you should see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ 33 tests passed.
```

All tests validate that the UI components work correctly and handle user interactions as expected, providing confidence that the application's user interface functions properly.

## Benefits Over Integration Tests

- **Platform Independent**: Works on web, mobile, and desktop
- **No External Dependencies**: Doesn't require backend or browser automation
- **Fast & Reliable**: Completes in seconds instead of minutes
- **Easy Debugging**: Clear error messages and stack traces
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Runs in any environment with Flutter

This approach provides effective "integration-style" testing by validating the complete user interface and interaction flows without the complexity and platform limitations of traditional integration tests.
